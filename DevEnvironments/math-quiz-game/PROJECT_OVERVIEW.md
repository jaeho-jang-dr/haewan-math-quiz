## 🎨 Enhanced Features vs Original

| Feature | Original | Enhanced |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Architecture** | Monolithic | Modular components |
| **Type Safety** | None | Full TypeScript |
| **Testing** | None | 60 comprehensive tests |
| **State Management** | useState chaos | Custom hooks |
| **Audio System** | Basic | Web Audio API with fallbacks |
| **Animations** | CSS only | Custom celebration system |
| **Build System** | None | Vite with optimization |
| **Code Quality** | No standards | ESLint + TypeScript |
